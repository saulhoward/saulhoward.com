Google’s announced a GPT-4 killer, Gemini, for release by December. There’s no question that OpenAI have a massive lead, but from the outside, it doesn’t look unassailable. LLMs may have presented Google with the first real threat to their search business.

LLMs hint at a new interface to computing. Microsoft’s strength isn’t interfaces, but sales. They can add LLM features to their software as customers need them. Apple can fall back on their hardware — and may see an increasing demand in consumer compute even as they slowly come around to updating iOS. But Google is only an interface. A single UI paradigm — search. They’ll need to move fast.

I was talking SEO today, and the paradigm already feels outdated. People out there still discovering software through search engines like boomers with cable subscriptions.
